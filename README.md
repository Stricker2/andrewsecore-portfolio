# Andrew Secore's Portfolio

## Description

My personal portfolio page built using only HTML and CSS. It will house works I've completed, and will be updated as I complete others. Resizing the page using media queries was the biggest hurdle to overcome, and while I was able to resize the page for screen sizes of 980px, 768px, and 525px, I hope to soon alleviate any discrepancies for other screens seemingly caused by an image link used in a future update.  

## Overview of Work Done

* Fully functioning navigation section to quickly take the user to the specific area of the page they wish to visit. 

* Introduction of myself and the motivation of my pursuit in this line of work. 

* Works section contains my only completed project (so far), and clicking on the image will open a new tab and redirect you to that webpage. Other images in this section are placeholders and will be replaced upon the completion of future projects. 

* Contact section including an email, which if right-clicked on the address can easily be copied and used for any potential email messages/inquiries. Section also includes an anchor linked to my GitHub, thus if clicked on it takes the user directly to my GitHub page. 

## Webpage

Feel free to visit the site! I have included a link below, as well as screenshots of the webpages at various 'px' sizes.
